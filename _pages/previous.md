Previous to founding Tepan, I was a dropout student from Stanford Computer Science, specializing in AI & robotics. I did some research in <a href="https://svl.stanford.edu/">Stanford Vision and Learning Lab</a>, as well as <a href="https://ilwiki.stanford.edu/doku.php?id=snap-servers:snap-servers">SNAP</a>.

I got my Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Illinois_Urbana-Champaign">University of Illiois at Urbana Champaign</a>, where I was adviced by <a href="http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~hasegawa/">Prof. Mark Hasegawa-Johnson</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u7vIZMoXXo">Prof. Jont Allen</a>, specializing in speech signal processing & machine learning. I did a college speedrun by graduating under 2.5 years, with the end mostly being research.

#### How I started doing engineering

In high school I was specializing in literature(like Shakespearean early-modern English or early 1800s American poetry). At the beginning of college, I saw GPT-2 could write essays, so I started learning python and training an LSTM on Shakespearean poetry. Later on I also played with computer vision and audio. I did an internship at Brunswick Corporation working on self-driving boats using imitation learning, and then did some research and published 4 papers about computational audio and language.

#### My pre-meditated dropout from Stanford

Chronologically, when I finished undergrad, I was accepted to the EECS PhD program at <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/">Berkely AI Reserach</a> with full scholarship and some additional stipends, as well as CS program from Stanford. I knew I wasn't gonna do research for another 5 years and would probably drop out soon to do a startup, so I enrolled in the latter and dropped out around a year later.
