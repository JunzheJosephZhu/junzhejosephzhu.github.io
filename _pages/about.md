I'm a second year Master's student in the Computer Science department at <a href="#">Stanford University</a>, specializing in AI & robotics. I briefly did some research in <a href="https://svl.stanford.edu/">Stanford Vision and Learning Lab</a>, before I decided to quit doing research for a while and build my own startup. 

I got my Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Illinois_Urbana-Champaign">University of Illiois at Urbana Champaign</a>, where I was adviced by <a href="http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~hasegawa/">Prof. Mark Hasegawa-Johnson</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u7vIZMoXXo">Prof. Jont Allen</a>, specializing in speech signal processing & machine learning.

<h4>Why I didn't do a PhD<h4>
<p><b>Q</b>: I was accepted to the PhD program at <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/">Berkely AI Reserach</a> with a lot of stipend and all that, but I chose to do an MS instead. Why?</p>
<p><s><b>A</b>: But Alas, a man's gotta eat.</s> I want to grow skillsets more quickly by having a broad coverage in projects, rather than discover new grounds on a singular topic.</p>

<p>I write everything from low-level <a style="padding-top: 200pt; margin-top: -200pt; color:purple;" id="embedded-code" href="#embedded-code" class="collapsible">embedded robotics code</a>,

 <i class="content" style="background-color:pink"><br><br>For example, recently when working on the startup, I dabbled in stepper control stuff and modified <a href="https://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper/">the arduino AccelStepper</a> library to compute stepper pulse intervals in real time based on high-frequency waypoint inputs on a mere Arduino nano(where I won't be able to use square root/division if I don't want to miss a pulse) by extending <a href="https://www.embedded.com/generate-stepper-motor-speed-profiles-in-real-time/">this paper</a>. <br><br> </i>
 
 fast solvers(using numerical integrators) for forward/inverse kinematics of parallel-linkage robots, custom AI architectures/math, AI deployment code, speech codecs based on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3999091_Code-excited_Linear_Prediction_CELP_High_Quality_Speech_at_Very_Low_Bit_Rates"> Bell Lab papers</a> from the 80s(finding docs for these is a pain), AI + speech signal processing stuff. I'm recently learning front-end and all that(by making this website).</p>
 <p> I did my undergrad in EE, so I understand how analog & digital circuits work on a fundamental level(for example, how radio/electromagnetic waves work). Thanks to the coaching of <a href="https://math.illinois.edu/resources/department-resources/syllabus-math-487">Prof. Jont Allen</a>, I got to learn about dynamical system, and <a href="https://auditorymodels.org/index.php?n=Courses.ECE498-ECENeuroScience-S21">how neurons work on the electrical level</a>. I recently shifted my attention to the mechanical equivalent of these systems(fluid mechanics, deformable objects, etc).</p>
