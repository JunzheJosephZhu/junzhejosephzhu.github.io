                By far the most comfy job I've had. Free lunches at 15 different canteens, bi-weekly chiropractor treatment, unlimited ergonomic keyboards and <a href="https://foursquare.com/v/facebook-mpk-29/5ade50751ffed7260e208396?openPhotoId=62b240e03e8e927a2416f98a">Herman Miller Aerons</a>. They even had an ice-cream bar in office. True definition of a 9-5 job, pinnacle of The American Dream.<br>
                I was working at Reality Lab's AI team. My job was to write <b>a distillation frameworks for activity detection models</b> running on AR glasses. Basically, the concept is that inside Facebook, we have the data & compute to train huge self-supervised "foundation models"(like VLP transformer, etc) using video-language-audio contrastive training and such such, but those models are too big to be deployed on the AR glasses. On the other hand, the "on-glass" model are small video processing neural networks(like MViT, X3D, etc), but those have lower accuracy if trained normally with supervised learning. My job was to write a framework where we can extract features & soft probability predictions from the big models, and train the smaller models using those. This is a huge performance booster, I was able to boost the mAP on a 100+ category video classification model from 0.32 to 0.49.

                Encoding human speech at 2kb/s bitrate to let you have meetings in an underground parking structure/elevator. Mingled a bunch of GAN(Generative Adversarial Networks) and signal compression stuff made in Bell Labs from the 80s.
                I forgot to save a recording when I left the job, this is something I managed to produce halfway through the internship.<br>

                In 2019 when I was a sophomore, I was really intrigued by neural networks(not the ones you train, I'm talking about the ones in the human brain) and the PDE(partial differential equation) that governs it, so I read <a href="http://jontalle.web.engr.illinois.edu/Public/Scott-Neuroscience.02.pdf">this book</a>. I wanted to do research on it, so I was planning on going to go to MIT's <a href="https://mcgovern.mit.edu/">McGovern Institue</a> to do some research in Summer 2020. However, Covid hit, and MIT completely stopped hiring staff, so I couldn't go there in person. I winded up doing some part-time remote research. I just stumbled upon the old code I wrote and decided to <a href="https://github.com/JunzheJosephZhu/metalearning_pytorch.git">open source it</a>. Maybe I'd be a neuroscience PhD by now if I was able to go there in person, who knows?

                Brunswick was my first job in America. I was getting paid $16/hour and at the time that was big money to me. I also for the first time got to work as an "engineer". I was learning things like object detection, semantic segmentation, path planning. I got the chance to work on a lot of cool projects. For one here, I am teaching a boat how to dock itself:<br>

                I also made <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/082UIG4ZXog?feature=share">an imitation learning proof-of-concept with an omnidirectional robot for docking.</a><br>
                I took care of a variety of other projects, like doing NLP stuff on 600k patents, write the trajectory for a drone to take videos, classifying satillite images to analyze our users, etc.
